# Twitter Analysis for Coding DÃ¼rer: http://codingdurer.de/
A small analysis on the twitter usage during coding durer in munich. I have used the twitter API to get all tweets between 13.03. and 19.03. for the hashtag #codingdurer. I have removed some uninteresting words (e.g. stop words and twitter account names) from the data and used singularization.
